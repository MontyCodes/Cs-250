As we know active listening in essential in interpreting user stories as you need to truly understand what the users needs are in relation to the app. Once these stories are received they can be turned into technical requirements for our developers to work on. 
My focus in developing programs is on iterative and incremental progress, an essential first step is first having a clear understanding of just what the core problems to be solved are followed by breaking them down into manageable tasks. I hope to incorporate Agile processes like Scrum, particularly daily stand-ups for quick synchronization and obstacle identification, and regular sprint reviews to gather feedback and adapt to evolving requirements.
The qualities of being a good team member can be very subjective as everyone has a different definition in their minds. In my opinion I believe a good team member involves being able to offer constructive criticism in a manner that does not sound either condescending or off putting, being able to openly communicate with others is also essential as without communication one cannot hope to ever get their necessary points across.
